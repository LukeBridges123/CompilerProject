Lewi: string casting, string length WAT (used in size()), string concatenation, began char * int operation, indexing (as rvalue)

Luke: Function calls (parsing and code generation), size() codegen, finished char->string promotion and char * int operation

Rose: WAT parser (to turn handwritten WAT into WATExpr objects), handwritten WAT injection, memory allocation, string literals, indexing (as lvalue) 

I'll note in passing that we have the "recursive functions" extra credit implemented (though we never had to do it explicitly--it worked as soon as we got function calls working).
